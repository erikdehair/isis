 * Implementations are expected to implement the {@link #getStart()} and 
 * {@link #getCount()} methods, which are used to support range / paging
 * the data. Returned result sets are expected to start from index "start",
 * and no more than "count" items are expected.

 * <b>Note:</b> that not every object store will necessarily support this
 * interface. In particular, the in-memory object store does not. For this, you
 * can use the {@link Predicate} interface to similar effect, for example in
 * {@link DomainObjectContainer#allMatches(Class, Predicate, long...)}). Note that the
 * predicate is applied within the {@link DomainObjectContainer} (ie client-side)
 * rather than being pushed back to the object store.
