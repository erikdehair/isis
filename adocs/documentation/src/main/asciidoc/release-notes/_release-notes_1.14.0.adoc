Apache Isis 1.14.0 introduces one significant new feature, namely the ability to invoke actions with collection parameters.
This is rendered by the Wicket viewer as a multi-select drop-down.
It is also captured in the DTO/XML for both commands and published interaction events.
Note though that Restful Objects viewer currently does not provide any support.

Also included in the release are a number of minor improvements.
In particular, there are now a number of metamodel validations intended to make it apps already in production easier to refactor.
These include a new `objectType` attribute for `@DomainService`, analogous to the same attribute on `@DomainObject`.
The `EmailService` has been improved so it is easier to use in system test (non-prod) environments.
Finally, a new `TableColumnOrderService` to allow column order to be fine-tuned.

The release also has a number of bug fixes.

Most applications written against v1.13.x should run against v1.14.0 with few if any changes.
That said, we do recommend that you read and keep in mind the xref:../migration-notes/migration-notes.adoc#_migration-notes_1.13.0-to-1.14.0[migration notes] when you upgrade your app.
