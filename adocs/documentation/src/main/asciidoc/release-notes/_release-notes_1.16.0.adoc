This release introduces a couple of new features and improvements.

* a new `Module` interface (and `ModuleAbstract` adapter class) allows transitive dependencies to be defined between modules, and allowing optional setup and teardown fixtures to be defined for the module

* Application bootstrapping has been simplified further with a new `AppManifest2` interface (and `AppManifestAbstract2` adapter class) defined in terms of ``Module``s.

+
Similarly, integration testing bootstrapping has been simplified with a new `IntegrationTestAbstract3` adapter class that also uses a `Module`.

+
BDD specs (Cucumber) have also been simplified to be bootstrapped with a `Module`, with a much more "conventional" programming model (domain services can be injected into spec "glue", the same as for integration tests)

* Fixture scripts have been improved (the `BuilderScriptAbstract` subclass) to allow enums to act as "personas".
An enum instance can be used to easily create corresponding domain objects,  and then later to look up that domain object from within a test

* menu bars can now be specified using a `menubars.layout.xml` file, expected to reside in the same package as the app manifest used to bootstrap the application

* The framework can be configured to require that actions are explicitly annotatedusing `@Action`.
This therefore removes the requirement to annotate non-action methods with `@Programmatic`.

There are also numerous improvements and bug fixes.

Applications written against v1.15.x should run against v1.16.0 with few if any changes.
However, note that applications *are* required to bootstrap from an `AppManifest`.
