Apache Isis' security mechanism is configurable, specifying an `Authenticator` and an `Authorizor` (non-public) APIs.
The Shiro security mechanism is an integration wih Apache Shiro that implements both interfaces.

[TIP]
====
Both the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[HelloWorld] and xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp] archetypes are pre-configured to use Apache Shiro, so much of what follows may well have been set up already.
====


== Telling Apache Isis to use Shiro

To tell Apache Isis to use Shiro when using an xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#__rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping_bootstrapping_AppManifestAbstract[`AppManifestAbstract.BUILDER`], simply specify the "authMechanism" as "shiro".

For example, the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[HelloWorld archetype] bootstraps using:

[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorldAppManifest extends AppManifestAbstract {

    public static final Builder BUILDER = Builder
            .forModules(HelloWorldModule.class)
            .withAuthMechanism("shiro");                        // <1>
            ...
}
----
<1> configures Shiro.

This installs the appropriate implementation (the `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` class) that use Shiro's APIs to perform authentication and authorization:

image::{_imagesdir}security/security-apis-impl/configure-isis-to-use-shiro.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}security/security-apis-impl/configure-isis-to-use-shiro.png"]

The figure above doesn't tell the whole story; we haven't yet seen how Shiro itself is configured to use realms.
The `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` is in essence the glue between the Apache Isis runtime and Shiro.


== Configuring Shiro Authenticator

The `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` class itself supports a single optional property.
This can be configured in `authentication_shiro.properties` file:

[source,ini]
----
isis.authentication.shiro.autoLogoutIfAlreadyAuthenticated=false
----

This configuration property only comes into effect for the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer]; if set then the Shiro subject - if found to be still authenticated - will be logged out anyway and then re-authenticated.

[WARNING]
====
There should generally be no need to change this property from its default (`false`).
Setting it to `true` may cause a race condition resulting in exceptions being logged.
====



== Bootstrapping Shiro

The Shiro environment (in essence, thread-locals holding the security credentials) needs to be bootstrapped using the following settings in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<listener>
    <listener-class>org.apache.shiro.web.env.EnvironmentLoaderListener</listener-class>
</listener>
<filter>
    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ShiroFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
----

Based on this Shiro will then read `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file to configure its Realm definitions for authentication and authorization.



== `WEB-INF/shiro.ini`

The `shiro.ini` file is used to specify the realm(s) that Shiro will delegate to:

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $realmName
----

Shiro's ini file supports a "poor-man's" dependency injection (link:https://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html[their words]), and so `$realmName` in the above example is a reference to a realm defined elsewhere in `shiro.ini`.
The subsequent sections describe the specifics for thevarious realm implementations available to you.


It's also possible to configure Shiro to support multiple realms.

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $realm1,$realm2
----

You can learn more about Shiro realms in the link:http://shiro.apache.org/realm.html[Shiro documentation].
