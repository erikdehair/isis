The `HasUsername` interface is a mix-in for domain objects to be associated with a username.
Other services and modules can then contribute actions/collections to render such additional information relating to the activities of the user.

The interface is defined is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HasUsername {
    public String getUsername();
}
----

* security module: `ApplicationUser` entity, `HasUsernameContributions` service
* audit module: `AuditEntry` entity
* command module: `CommandJdo` entity, `HasUsernameContributions` service
* sessionlogger module: `SessionLogEntry` entity, `HasUsernameContributions` service
