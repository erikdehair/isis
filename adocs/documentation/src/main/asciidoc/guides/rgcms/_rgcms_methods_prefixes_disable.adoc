The `disable...()` supporting method is called for properties, collections and actions.
It allows the modification of the property/collection to be vetoed (ie made read-only) and to prevent the invocation of the action ("grey it out").

[NOTE]
====
Directly mutable collections are not currently supported by the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]; they are always implicitly disabled.
====

Typically modification/invocation is vetoed based on the state of the domain object being interacted with, though it could be any reason at all (eg the current date/time of the interaction, or the state of some other related data such as stock levels, or the identity of the calling user).


The reason for vetoing a modification/invocation is normally returned as a string.
However, Apache Isis' xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18n support] extends this so that reasons can be internationalized.



The signature of the supporting method is simply:

[source,java]
----
public String disableXxx() { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason the property cannot be edited, or the action invoked.


For i18n, the supporting method returns a `TranslatableString`:

[source,java]
----
public TranslatableString disableXxx() { ... }
----

The returned string is then automatically translated to the locale of the current user.


For example, to disable an action:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public String disablePlaceOrder() {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Blacklisted customers cannot place orders"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----


Or, to disable a property:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public String disableCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted()
                    ? "Cannot change credit limit for blacklisted customers"
                    : null;
    }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
In the case of actions, the framework will also search for supporting method that has the exact same parameter types as the action itself.
Enabling `isis.reflector.validator.noParamsOnly` configuration property switches this off, so that the framework will only search for supporting method with no parameters.

Note that enabling this configuration property in effect means that xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_mixins[mixins] must be used instead of xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_programming-model_domain-services_contributions[contributed services] (because contributed actions are the one case where the value of a parameter to a supporting method may be non-null).
