The Wicket viewer provides a secondary navigation scheme that allows users to quickly access domain objects, that are organized in a hierarchical manner. 

This hierarchy can be understood as a navigable tree-structure, where the navigable tree-nodes are either domain objects or domain views. Domain objects that take part in such a navigable-tree-structure need to declare their actual navigable parent within this hierarchy. That's all the framework needs, in order to build a navigable-tree. We introduced the `@Parent` annotation with version 2.0 to allow declarative specification of a domain object's navigable parent. 

In other words: a domain object or view may declare it's parent (with respect to the navigable tree-structure it is part of) via use of the `@Parent` annotation.


== Screenshots

The following screenshot shows the navigation links below the top menu bar.

== Domain Code

To declare a domain object's (or view's) navigable parent, add the `@Parent` annotation to a field (that has an associated getter) or a no-arg method, that returns the parent object:

[source,java]
----

@DomainObject
public class Company { ... }

@DomainObject
public class Employee {

    @Parent @Getter // annotated field with e.g. lombok provided getter
    Company myCompany;
}

@DomainObject
public class PhoneNumber {

    @Parent  // annotated no-arg supplier
    Employee employee(){
        return ...
    }

}

----

This results in a navigable tree-structure ...

Company > Employee > PhoneNumber

=== How to use @Parent annotation

. `@Parent` annotations used within Java interfaces are ignored. These do not contribute to the domain meta model.
. Any class (abstract or concrete) may at most have one @Parent annotation (on either a method or a field); otherwise meta-model validation will fail.
. The annotated member (method or field), when ...
.. ... a method: then must be a no-arg method returning a non-primitive type (e.g. a getter)
.. ... a field: then the field must be of non-primitive type and must also have a getter (as specified by the Java Beans Standard, particularly to allow @Parent annotations on fields that use the lombok @Getter annotation)
. Starting from the current domain-object, we search the object's class inheritance hierarchy (super class, super super class, ...), until we find the first class that has a `@Parent` annotation. That's the one we use to resolve the current domain-object's navigable parent.


== User Experience

When viewing a domain object that is part of a hierarchical structure, one can easily navigate to any parent of this object. Horizontally arranged text links separated by the 'greater than' symbol (>) are provided below the main menu. (Traditionally called breadcrumbs.)



== Related functionality


The navigable tree-structure, as provided by the 'Where am I' feature, is declared at compile-time (predefined by the programmer), whereas related features (xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_recent-pages[Recent Pages] and xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_bookmarked-pages[Bookmarked Pages]) are populated at runtime only after user interaction.


== Configuration

By default, the 'Where am I' feature will show a maximum of 64 links. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.whereAmI.maxParentChainLength=20
----

To disable the 'Where am I' feature, override the default (=enabled) by using a property (in `isis.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.whereAmI.enabled=false
----
