The annotations-based approach for arranging the placement of menu items is achieved through the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-MemberOrder[`@MemberOrder`] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout[`@DomainServiceLayout`] annotations.

== @DomainServiceLayout

In the example from Estatio shown above the top-level menu combines the actions from the `Properties`, `Units` and `FixedAssetRegistrations` services.
The `Properties` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class Properties ... { ... }
----

while the `Units` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.2"
)
public class Units ... { ... }
----

and similarly `FixedAssetRegistrations` is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.3"
)
public class FixedAssetRegistrations ... { ... }
----

Note that in all three cases the value of the `named` attribute and the `menuBar` attribute is the same: "Fixed Assets" and PRIMARY.
This means that all will appear on a "Fixed Assets" menu in the primary menu bar.

Meanwhile the value of `menuOrder` attribute is significant for two reasons:

* for these three services on the same ("Fixed Assets") top-level menu, it determines the relative order of their sections (`Properties` first, then `Units`, then `FixedAssetRegistrations`)

* it determines the placement of the top-level menu itself ("Fixed Assets") with respect to other top-level menus on the menu bar.

To illustrate this latter point, the next top-level menu on the menu bar, "Parties", is placed after "Fixed Assets" because the `menuOrder` of the first of its domain services, namely the `Parties` service, is higher than that for "Fixed Assets":

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Parties",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "20.1"
)
public class Parties ... { ... }
----

Note that only the `menuOrder` of the _first_ domain service is significant in placing the menus along the menu bar; thereafter the purpose of the `menuOrder` is to order the menu services sections on the menu itself.



== Ordering menu actions

For a given service, the actions within a section on a menu is determined by the `@MemberOrder` annotation.
Thus, for the `Units` domain service, its actions are annotated:

[source,java]
----
public class Units extends EstatioDomainService<Unit> {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public Unit newUnit( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<Unit> findUnits( ... ) { ... }

    @ActionLayout( prototype = true )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "99")
    public List<Unit> allUnits() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Note that the last is also a prototype action (meaning it is only displayed in SERVER_PROTOTYPE (=Wicket Development) mode).
In the UI it is rendered in italics.



== Tertiary Menu


Domain services' actions can be associated with the tertiary menu using the same `@DomainServiceLayout` annotation, but be aware that the `@DomainServiceLayout#name()` attribute will be ignored (there is only one effective menu).

For example, the `updateEpochDate(...)` and `listAllSettings(...)` actions come from the following service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.TERTIARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class EstatioAdministrationService ... {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public void updateEpochDate( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<ApplicationSetting> listAllSettings() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Because the number of items on the tertiary menu is expected to be small and most will pertain to the current user, the viewer does _not_ place dividers between actions from different services on the tertiary menu.
