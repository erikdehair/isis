In implementing the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects[naked objects pattern], Apache Isis aims to infer as much information from the domain classes as possible.
Nevertheless, some metadata relating solely to the UI is inevitably required.
This chapter describes how this is done both for domain objects using either annotations or using an associated layout file.

It also describes how to layout the application menu items (containing domain service' actions), as more well as more advanced topics such as customising which columns appear in tables.
