The actions of domain services are made available as menu items on menus.
By default each domain service corresponds to a single menu on this menu bar, with its actions as the drop-down menu items.
This is rarely exactly what is required, however; it often makes sense to group menu items for similar domain services together.

For example, the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] modules provides services whose actions appear into two top-level menus:

* its `ApplicationUsers`, `ApplicationRoles`, `ApplicationPermission`, `ApplicationFeatureViewModels` and `ApplicationTenancies` domain services are all grouped together in a single "Security" top-level menu, on the SECONDARY menu bar

* its `MeService` domain service, which provides the `me()` action, is placed on the TERTIARY menu bar.


The menus themselves can be placed either on a primary, secondary or tertiary menu bar, as shown in this screenshot (taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio], an open source estate management application built using Apache Isis):

Within a single top-level menu (eg "Fixed Assets") there can be actions from multiple services.
The Wicket viewer shows these as separate sections, with a divider between each:

The tertiary menu bar consists of a single unnamed menu, rendered underneath the user's login, top right.
This is intended primarily for actions pertaining to the user themselves, eg their account, profile or settings:

The Apache Isis framework provides two mechanisms to control the arrangement of domain service actions across menubars and menus, either using annotations or using a file-based layout.
