Apache Isis' documentation (meaning the website and the users' guide, the reference guide and this contributors' guide) is written using link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc], specifically the link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] implementation.

The website and guides are created by running build tools (documented below) which create the HTML version of the site and guides.
You can therefore easily check the documentation before raising a pull request (as a contributor) or publishing the site (if a committer).

To help write the Asciidoc text itself, we provide some xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_asciidoc-templates[Asciidoc templates].

Publishing is performed by copying the generated HTML to a different git repository (link:https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=isis-site.git[isis-site]).
Since this can only be done by Apache Isis committers, the process for doing this is described in the xref:../cgcom/cgcom.adoc#_cgcom_asciidoc-publish-procedure[committers' guide].
This is synced by ASF infrastructure over to link:http://isis.apache.org[isis.apache.org].
