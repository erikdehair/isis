Some pointers on how to xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_deployment_externalized-configuration[externalize configuration] when deploying to Tomcat.
Other servlet containers have similar mechanisms.


== Tomcat 8.0

If deploying Tomcat 8.0, create a file called `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/todoapp.xml`, where `todoapp.xml` corresponds to the name of the webapp being deployed, eg `todoapp.war`.

The contents of this file would be something like:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context>

    <WatchedResource>WEB-INF/web.xml</WatchedResource>
    <Manager pathname="" />

    <Parameter name="shiroConfigLocations"
               value="file:/var/todoapp/dev/shiro.ini"
               override="false" />

    <Parameter name="isis.config.dir"
               value="/var/todoapp/dev/"
               override="false" />

    <Parameter name="spring.config.file"
               value="file:/var/todoapp/dev/spring.properties"
               override="false" />

    <Parameter name="wicket.configuration"
               value="development"
               override="false" />

</Context>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that the `override` key should be set to "false", not "true".
It indicates whether the application's own `web.xml` can override the setting.
In most cases, you probably want to disallow that.
====

Thus, when `todoapp.war` is deployed to `$CATALINA_HOME/webapp`, then this configuration will be used.

For more detail, see the Tomcat 8.0 documentation on link:http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html#Defining_a_context[defining a context] and on link:http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html#Context_Parameters[context parameters].

== Tomcat 7.0

If using Tomcat 7.0, the process is similar to that of Tomcat 8.0, however the override file resides in `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf`, rather than `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost`.

For more detail, see the Tomcat 7.0 documentation on link:http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html#Defining_a_context[defining a context] and on link:http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html#Context_Parameters[context parameters].
