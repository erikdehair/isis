When writing integration tests, it's easiest to inherit from a base class:

* as of (`1.15.0`), use `IntegrationTestAbstract2`
* for earlier releases, use (its superclass) `IntegrationTestAbstract`.

This base class xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support_bootstrapping[bootstraps] the framework (caching the framework on a thread-local), and provides various utility methods and framework-provided services for use by your application's subclass tests.

== `IntegrationTestAbstract2`

(As of `1.15.0`) we recommend that your integration tests inherit from Apache Isis' `IntegrationTestAbstract2` class:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class DomainAppIntegTest extends IntegrationTestAbstract2 {
    ...
}
----


Although not mandatory, this provides a number of helper/convenience methods and JUnit rules:

[source,java]
----
    @Rule
    public IsisTransactionRule isisTransactionRule =                         // <1>
        new IsisTransactionRule();
    @Rule
    public JUnitRuleMockery2 context =                                       // <2>
        JUnitRuleMockery2.createFor(Mode.INTERFACES_AND_CLASSES);
    @Rule
    public ExpectedException expectedExceptions =                            // <3>
        ExpectedException.none();
    @Rule
    public ExceptionRecognizerTranslate exceptionRecognizerTranslations =    // <4>
        ExceptionRecognizerTranslate.create();
----
<1> ensures an Apache Isis session/transaction running for each test
<2> sets up a JMock context (using Apache Isis' extension to JMock as described in xref:../ugtst/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_unit-test-support_jmock-extensions[JMock Extensions].
<3> standard JUnit rule for writing tests that throw exceptions
<4> to capture messages that require translation, as described in xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[i18 support].

All of these rules could be inlined in your own base class; as we say, they are a convenience.

The `IntegrationTestAbstract2` also provides a number of helper/convenience methods, though most of these have been deprecated because the functionality they expose is now readily accessible through various domain services; most notably these are:

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`]

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`]

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_metadata-api_ServiceRegistry[`ServiceRegistry2`]

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`] +
+
to wrap objects simulating interaction through the user interface)

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`] +
+
most commonly used to commit changes after the fixture setup) and,

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_SessionManagementService[`SessionManagementService`] +
+
for tests that check interactions over multiple separate sessions.

== `IntegrationTestAbstract`

For earlier releases we recommend that your base class inherit from Apache Isis' `IntegrationTestAbstract` class:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class DomainAppIntegTest extends IntegrationTestAbstract {
    ...
}
----

This provides most of the benefits of `IntegrationTestAbstract2` (it is the latter's superclass, in fact), but the xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support_bootstrapping[bootstrapping] is more verbose.
