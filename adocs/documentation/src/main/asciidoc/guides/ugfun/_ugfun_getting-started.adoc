To get you up and running quickly, Apache Isis provides two archetypes:

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[HelloWorld archetype] generates a one domain class application so you can quickly learn about Apache Isis by trying it out. +
+
For simplisty, the generated application is a single Maven module containing both the business logic classes and the bootstrapping code.

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype], a slightly more sophisticated one domain class version suitable for use as the basis of your own apps. +
+
This is still quite minimal so that you won't have to spend lots of time removing generated artifacts.
On the other hand, it does set up a standard multi-module maven structure with unit- and integration tests pre-configured, as well as a webapp module so that you can easily run your app.
We strongly recommend that you preserve this structure as you develop your own Isis application.

In this chapter we also discuss the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_datanucleus-enhancer[DataNucleus enhancer].
link:http://www.datanucleus.org/[DataNucleus] is the reference implementation of the JDO (Java Data Objects) spec, and Apache Isis integrates with DataNucleus as its persistence layer.
The enhancer performs post-processing on the bytecode of your persistent domain entities, such that they can be persisted by Apache Isis' JDO/DataNucleus objectstore.

[NOTE]
====
The xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[HelloWorld] and xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp] archetypes automatically configures the enhancer, so there's little you need to do at this stage.

Even so we feel it's a good idea to be aware of this critical part of Apache Isis runtime; if the enhancer does not run, then you'll find the app fails to start with (what will seem like) quite an obscure exception message.
