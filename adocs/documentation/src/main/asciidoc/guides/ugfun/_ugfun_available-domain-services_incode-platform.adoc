The (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] provides a number of reusable modules for Apache Isis, focusing either on specific technologies, technical cross-cutting concerns, or providing business logic for generic subdomains.
Some of these modules implement SPIs defined by the framework.


[WARNING]
====
Note that the Incode Platform, although maintained by Apache Isis committers, are not part of the ASF.
====


The modules themselves fall into a number of broader groups:

* technical libraries, such as excel, word and freemarker

* SPI implementations, such as security, commands, auditing and publishing

* framework extensions, such as flyway, quartz and feature toggles

* wicket components, such as maps, calendars and PDF viewer

* business modules, such as documents, notes and communications.

Each module can be used independently or combined, and the Incode Platform also provides a quickstart application to get you started quickly.
