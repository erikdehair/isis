Contributed properties are defined similarly, for example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="prop")
public class DocumentHolder_mostRecentDocument {

    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolderDocuments(DocumentHolder holder) { this.holder = holder; }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)                         // <1>
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)     // <2>
    public Document prop() {                                    // <3>
        ...
    }
    public boolean hiderProp() { ... }                          // <4>
}
----
<1> required; actions that have side-effects cannot be contributed as collections
<2> required; otherwise the mixin will default to being rendered as an action
<3> must accept no arguments.
The mixin is a property rather than a collection because the return type is a scalar.
<4> supporting methods follow the usual naming conventions.
(That said, in the case of properties, because the property is derived/read-only, the only supporting method that is relevant is `hideProp()`).
