The most significant aspect of the UI is the layout of the object's members: its properties, collections and actions.
These can be organized into columns, rows and tabs.

This can be accomplished using either annotations or through a separate file-based layout.
Since this is a large topic, it has its own xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout[layout chapter] in the Wicket viewer guide.
