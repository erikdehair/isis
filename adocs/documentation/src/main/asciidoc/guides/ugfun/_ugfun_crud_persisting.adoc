Once a domain entity has been instantiated, it must be persisted.
This is done using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`].
For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = ...

repositoryService.persist(customer);
----

If using the no-arg form to instantiate the entity, then (to save having to inject two services), the `RepositoryService` can also be used to instantiate.
This gives rise to this common idiom:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = repositoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);
customer.setReference(reference);
customer.setFirstName(firstName);
customer.setLastName(lastName);
...
repositoryService.persist(customer);
----

It's worth being aware that the framework does _not_ eagerly persist the object.
Rather, it queues up an internal command structure representing the object persistence request.
This is then executed either at the end of the transaction, or if a xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_crud_finding[query is run], or if the internal queue is manually flushed using xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`]'s `flush()` method.

Alternatively, you can use:

[source,java]
----
repositoryService.persistAndFlush(customer);
----

to eagerly perform the object insertion into the database.

When an object is persisted the framework will emit `ObjectPersistingEvent` and `ObjectPersistedEvent` xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle events].



[TIP]
====
It is also possible to configure DataNucleus to automatically persist domain entities if they are associated with other already-persistent entities.
This avoid the need to explicitly call "persist".

For this, configure the persistence-by-reachability property:

.isis.properties
[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit=true
----

The downside is that the code is arguably less easy to debug.
