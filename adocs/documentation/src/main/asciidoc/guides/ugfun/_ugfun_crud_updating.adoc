There is no specific API to update a domain entity.
Rather, the ORM (DataNucleus) automatically keeps track of the state of each object and will update the corresponding database rows when the transaction completes.

That said, it is possible to "flush" pending changes:

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`] acts at the Apache Isis layer, and flushes any pending object persistence or object deletions

* using xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] it is possible to reach down to the underlying JDO API, and perform a flush of pending object updates also.


When an object is updated the framework will emit `ObjectUpdatingEvent` and `ObjectUpdatedEvent` xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle events].
