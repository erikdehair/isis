Both domain entities and view models can be instantiated using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`] provided by the framework.
For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = factoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);
----

or

[source,java]
----
Dashboard dashboardVM = factoryService.instantiate(Dashboard.class);
----

When the framework instantiates the object, all services are injected into the framework, and an `ObjectCreatedEvent` xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle event] will also be emitted.


For this to work the target class _must_ have a no-arg constructor.

However, you may prefer for your domain objects to have regular constructor defining their minimum set of mandatory properties.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public Customer(String reference, String firstName, String lastName) { ... }

    ...
}
----

In such cases, the domain object cannot be instantiated using `FactoryService`.
Instead the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_metadata-api_ServiceRegistry[`ServiceRegistry`] service can be used to inject services:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = new Customer(reference, firstName, lastName);
serviceRegister.injectServicesInto(customer);
----

Note that this does _not_ raise any lifecycle event.


To instantiate a mixin, a different API of `FactoryService` is used:

[source,java]
----
Customer_placeOrder placeOrderMixin = factoryService.mixin(Customer_placeOrder.class, customer);
----

Alternatively and equivalently, the mixin can be manually instantiated, and then the services injected directly:

[source,java]
----
Customer_placeOrder placeOrderMixin = new Customer_placeOrder(customer);
serviceRegistry.injectServicesInto(placeOrderMixin);
----
