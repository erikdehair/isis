Contributed services are very similar to mixins; indeed mixins are an evolution and refinement of the contributions concept.
As such, contributions should be considered as deprecated, and eventually removed in a future version of the framework, to be replaced entirely by mixins.

The main difference between contributed services and mixins is that the actions of a contributed service will contribute to _all_ the parameters of its actions, whereas a mixin only contributes to the type accepted in its constructor.

Also, contributed services are long-lived singletons, whereas mixins are instantiated as required (by the framework) and then discarded almost immediately.

== Syntax

Any n-parameter action provided by a service will automatically be contributed to the list of actions for each of its (entity) parameters.
From the viewpoint of the entity the action is called a contributed action.

For example, given a service:

[source,java]
----
public interface Library {
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b);
}
----

and the entities:

[source,java]
----
public class Book implements Loanable { ... }
----

and

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember implements Borrower { ... }
----

then the `borrow(...)` action will be contributed to both `Book` and to `LibraryMember`.
