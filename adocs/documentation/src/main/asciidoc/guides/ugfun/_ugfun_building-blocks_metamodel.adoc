At its core, Apache Isis is a metamodel that is built at runtime from the domain classes (eg `Customer.java`), along with optional supporting metadata (eg `Customer.layout.xml`).

The contents of this metamodel is inferred from the Java classes discovered on the classpath: the entities and supporting services, as well the members of those classes.
The detail of the metamodel is generally explicit, usually represented by Java annotations such as `@Title` or `@Action`.
Notably the metamodel is xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model[extensible]; it is possible to teach Apache Isis new programming conventions/rules (and conversely to remove those that are built in).

Most of the annotations recognized by the framework are defined by the Apache Isis framework itself.
For example the `@Title` annotation -- which identifies how the framework should derive a human-readable label for each rendered domain object -- is part of the `org.apache.isis.applib.annotations` package.
However the framework also recognizes certain other JEE annotations such as `@javax.inject.Inject` (used for dependency injection).

The framework uses DataNucleus for its persistence mechanism.
This is an ORM that implements the JDO and JPA APIs, and which can map domain objects either to an RDBMS or to various NoSQL objectstores such as MongoDB or Neo4J.
Apache Isis recognizes a number of the JDO annotations such as `@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull=...)`.

In addition, the framework builds up the metamodel for each domain object using
xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout[layout hints], such as `Customer.layout.xml`.
These provide metadata such as grouping elements of the UI together, using multi-column layouts, and so on.
The layout file can be modified while the application is still running, and are picked up automatically; a useful way to speed up feedback.

[TIP]
====
At the time of writing Apache Isis only recognizes and supports the JDO API, though we expect JPA to be supported in the future.
