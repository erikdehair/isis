Services can optionally declare lifecycle callbacks to initialize them (when the app is deployed) and to shut them down (when the app is undeployed).

An Apache Isis session _is_ available when initialization occurs (so services can interact with the object store, for example).

The framework will call any `public` method annotated with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] with either no arguments of an argument of type `Map<String,String>`.
In the latter case, the framework passes in the configuration (`isis.properties` and any other component-specific configuration files).

Shutdown is similar; the framework will call any method annotated with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-PreDestroy[`@PreDestroy`].
