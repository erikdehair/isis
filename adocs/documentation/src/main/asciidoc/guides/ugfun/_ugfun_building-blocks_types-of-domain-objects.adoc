Apache Isis supports recognises four main types of domain classes:

* *domain entities* - domain objects persisted to the database using JDO/DataNucleus; for example `Customer`

* *domain services* - generally singletons, automatically injected, and providing various functionality; for example `CustomerRepository`

* *view models* - domain objects that are a projection of some state held by the database, in support a particular use case; for example `CustomerDashboard` (to pull together commonly accessed information about a customer).

* *mixins* - allow functionality to be "contributed" in the UI by one module to another object, similar to traits or extension methods provided in some programming languages.
This is an important capability to help keep large applications xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling[decoupled].

From the end-user's perspective the UI displays a single domain object instance that has state (that is, a domain entity or a view model) per page.
The end-user can then inspect and modify its state, and navigate to related objects.

Domain classes are generally recognized using annotations.
Apache Isis defines its own set of annotations, while entities are annotated using JDO/DataNucleus (though XML can also be used if required).
Apache Isis recognizes some of the JDO and JAXB annotations and infers domain semantics from these annotations.
Similarly, JAXB annotations are typically used for view models.
There is a smattering of other Java/JEE annotations that are also supported, such as `@javax.inject.Inject` and `@javax.annotation.Nullable`.

The following subsections explain this in further detail.
