The quickest way to get started building an application "for real" is to run the `simpleapp` archetype.
Like the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[helloworld archetype], this too will generate a very simple one-class domain model (an entity called `SimpleObject` with a couple of properties).

However, the generated application also provides more structure to assist you as your application grows.
For example:

* the application is multi-module, separating out the business logic (`module-simple` Maven module) from the bootstrapping modules (`application` Maven module and the `webapp` module)

* the `SimpleObjectRepository` service (to create/retrieve instances) is separate from the `SimpleObjectMenu` menu service (for the UI); the former is delegated to by the latter.

* a `HomePageViewModel` service acts as a home page for the app.

* there are example integration tests, BDD tests as well as unit tests

* there are example fixture scripts for use both when prototyping and used by the integration and BDD tests

* the xref:../rgmvn.adoc#[Apache Isis Maven plugin] to xref:../rgmvn.adoc#_rgmvn_validate[validate] your domain model is pre-configured

* Maven plugins to package your app as a Docker image is pre-configured


From this you can easily rename these initial classes, and extend to build up your own Apache Isis domain application.



[[__ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype_generating-the-app]]
== Generating the App

Create a new directory, and `cd` into that directory.

To build the app from the latest stable release, then run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.15.0 \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

where:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.




[[__ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype_building-the-app]]
== Building the App

Switch into the root directory of your newly generated app, and build your app:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
mvn clean install
----

where `myapp` is the `artifactId` entered above.




[[__ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype_running-the-app]]
== Running the App

The `simpleapp` archetype generates a single WAR file, configured to run both the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] and the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer].
The archetype also configures the DataNucleus/JDO Objectstore to use an in-memory HSQLDB connection.

Once you've built the app, you can run the WAR in a variety of ways.


=== Using mvn Jetty plugin

First, you could run the WAR in a Maven-hosted Jetty instance, though you need to `cd` into the `webapp` module:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----


You can also provide a system property to change the port:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run -D jetty.port=9090
----


=== Using a regular servlet container

You can also take the built WAR file and deploy it into a standalone servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org).
The default configuration does not require any configuration of the servlet container; just drop the WAR file into the `webapps` directory.



=== Using Docker

It's also possible to package up the application as a docker image to run as a container.

* To package up the application as a docker image (specifying the docker image name as a system property): +
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn install -Dmavenmixin-docker -Ddocker-plugin.imageName=mycompany/myapp
----
+
Alternatively, define the `${docker-plugin.imageName}` in the `webapp` module and use simply: +
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn install -Dmavenmixin-docker
----
+
The packaged image can be viewed using `docker images`.

* To run a docker image previously packaged: +
+
[source,bash]
----
docker container run -d -p 8080:8080 mycompany/myapp
----
+
This can then be accessed at link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080].
+
See link:https://github.com/danhaywood/java-mavenmixin-docker#how-to-consume[mavenmixin-docker] for further details on how to run docker images.

* To upload the application as a docker image to link:https://hub.docker.com[docker hub] (or some other docker registry): +
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp deploy -Dmavenmixin-docker
----
+
This assumes that the `${docker-plugin.imageName}` property has been defined, _and_ also that docker registry credentials have been specified in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.
Once more, see link:https://github.com/danhaywood/java-mavenmixin-docker#how-to-configure[mavenmixin-docker] for further details.



=== From within the IDE

Most of the time, though, you'll probably want to run the app from within your IDE.
The mechanics of doing this will vary by IDE; see the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_ide[Developers' Guide] for details of setting up Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Basically, though, it amounts to running `org.apache.isis.WebServer`, and ensuring that the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_datanucleus-enhancer[DataNucleus enhancer] has properly processed all domain entities.

Here's what the setup looks like in IntelliJ IDEA:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp.png"]

with the maven goal to run the DataNucleus enhancer (discussed in more detail xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_datanucleus-enhancer[here]) before launch defined as:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-before-launch.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-before-launch.png"]



[[__ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype_running-with-fixtures]]
== Running with Fixtures

It is also possible to start the application with a pre-defined set of data; useful for demos or manual exploratory testing.
This is done by specifying a xref:../ugtst/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts[fixture script] on the command line.

If you are running the app from an IDE, then you can specify the fixture script using the `--fixture` flag.  The archetype provides the `domainapp.fixture.scenarios.RecreateSimpleObjects` fixture script, for example:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-with-fixtures.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-with-fixtures.png"]

Alternatively, you can run with a different xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`] using the `--appManifest` (or `-m`) flag.
The archetype provides
`domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures` which specifies the aforementioned `RecreateSimpleObjects` fixture.



== Using the App

The generated application is almost identical similar to that generated by xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[helloworld archetype]; a description of how to use it can be found xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_using-the-app[here].

One additional feature that the simpleapp contains over the helloworld app is a home page.
This shows all domain objects (as installed by fixture scripts, described xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype_running-with-fixtures[above]).

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/030-home-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/030-home-page.png"]

It's also possible to run fixture scripts from the app itself:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/040-run-fixture-script-menu.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/040-run-fixture-script-menu.png"]

Some fixture scripts may allow their default behaviour to be tweaked ((eg specify how many objects to create):

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/050-run-fixture-script-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/050-run-fixture-script-prompt.png"]

The table summarises the resultant fixtures that were run:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/060-run-fixture-script-result.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/060-run-fixture-script-result.png"]

Navigating back to the home page shows the newly created objects:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/070-home-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/070-home-page.png"]



== Modifying the App

Once you are familiar with the generated app, you'll want to start modifying it.
There is plenty of guidance on this site; start with this guide (fundamentals) and then look at the other guides available the main xref:../../documentation.adoc#[documentation] page.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, do also install the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#__dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates (for IntelliJ)] / xref:../dg/dg.adoc#__dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates (for Eclipse)]; these will help you follow the Apache Isis naming conventions.



== App Structure

As noted above, the generated app is a very simple application consisting of a single domain object that can be easily renamed and extended.
The intention is not to showcase all of Apache Isis' capabilities; rather it is to allow you to very easily modify the generated application (eg rename `SimpleObject` to `Customer`) without having to waste time deleting lots of generated code.
