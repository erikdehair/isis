Here's a typical example of a JAXB view model, to allow (certain properties of) two ``Customer``s to be compared:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement(name = "compareCustomers")          // <1>
@XmlType(
        propOrder = {                               // <2>
            "customer1",
            "customer2"
        }
)
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)               // <3>
public class CompareCustomers {

    @XmlElement(required = true)                    // <4>
    @Getter @Setter
    Customer customer1;

    @XmlElement(required = true)                    // <4>
    @Getter @Setter
    Customer customer2;

    @XmlTransient                                   // <5>
    public String getCustomer1Name() {
        return getCustomer1().getName();
    }

    @XmlTransient                                   // <5>
    public String getCustomer1Address() {
        return getCustomer1().getAddress();
    }

    ...
}

<1> The JAXB `@XmlRootElement` annotation indicates this is a view model to Apache Isis, which then uses JAXB to serialize the state of the view model between interactions
<2> All properties of the view model must be listed using the `XmlType#propOrder` attribute.
<3> Specifying field accessor type allows the Lombok `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations to be used.
<4> The `XmlElement` indicates the property is part of the view model's state.
For collections, the `@XmlElementWrapper` would also typically be used.
<5> The `@XmlTransient` indicates that the property is derived and should be ignored by JAXB.

Use JAXB elements such as `@XmlElement` for properties and the combination of `@XmlElementWrapper` and `@XmlElement` for collections.
Properties can be ignored (for serialization) using `@XmlTransient`.

The derived properties could also have been implemented using xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_mixins[mixins].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Be aware that all the state will become the DTO's memento, ultimately converted into a URL-safe form, by way of the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`].

There are limits to the lengths of URLs, however.
If the URL does exceed limits or contains invalid characters, then provide a custom implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`] to handle the memento string in some other fashion (eg substituting it with a GUID, with the memento cached somehow on the server).
a URL.
