The easiest way to register domain services with the framework is to use an xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`].
This specifies the modules which contain xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService[`@DomainService`]-annotated classes.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
public class MyAppManifest implements AppManifest {
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ToDoAppDomainModule.class,
                ToDoAppFixtureModule.class,
                ToDoAppAppModule.class,
                org.isisaddons.module.audit.AuditModule.class);
    }
    ...
}
----

will load all services in the packages underneath the four modules listed.

An alternative (older) mechanism is to registered domain services in the `isis.properties` configuration file, under `isis.services` key (a comma-separated list); for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services = com.mycompany.myapp.employee.Employees\,
                com.mycompany.myapp.claim.Claims\,
                ...
----

This will then result in the framework instantiating a single instance of each of the services listed.

If all services reside under a common package, then the `isis.services.prefix` can specify this prefix:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.prefix = com.mycompany.myapp
isis.services = employee.Employees,\
                claim.Claims,\
                ...
----

This is quite rare, however; you will often want to use default implementations of domain services that are provided by the framework and so will not reside under this prefix.

Examples of framework-provided services (as defined in the applib) include clock, auditing, publishing, exception handling, view model support, snapshots/mementos, and user/application settings management; see the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#[domain services] reference guide for further details.
