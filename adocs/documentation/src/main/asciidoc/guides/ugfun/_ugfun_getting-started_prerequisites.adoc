Apache Isis is a Java based framework, so in terms of prerequisites, you'll need to install:

* Java 7 or 8 JDK
* link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] 3.x

You'll probably also want to use an IDE; the Apache Isis committers use either IntelliJ or Eclipse; in the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_ide[Developers' Guide] we have detailed setup instructions for using these two IDEs.
If you're a NetBeans user you should have no problems as it too has strong support for Maven.

When building and running within an IDE, you'll also need to configure the Datanucleus enhancer.
This is implemented as a Maven plugin, so in the case of IntelliJ, it's easy enough to run the enhancer as required.
It should be just as straightforward for NetBeans too.

For Eclipse the maven integration story is a little less refined.
All is not lost, however; DataNucleus also has an implementation of the enhancer as an Eclipse plugin, which usually works well enough.
