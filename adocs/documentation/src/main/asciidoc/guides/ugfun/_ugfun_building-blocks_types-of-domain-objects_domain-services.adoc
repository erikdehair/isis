_Domain services_ are (usually) singleton stateless services that provide additional functionality.
Domain services consist of a set of logically grouped actions, and as such follow the same conventions as for entities.
However, a service cannot have (persisted) properties, nor can it have (persisted) collections.

A very common type of domain service is a repository, that is used to look up existing instances of a domain entity.
For example, for the `Customer` entity there may be a `CustomerRepository`, while for `Order` entity there may be an `OrderRepository`.

Similarly, entities might also have a corresponding factory service: a `CustomerFactory` or an `OrderFactory`; Evans' link:http://books.google.com/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC[Domain Driven Design], draws a clear distinction is made between a factory (that creates object) and a repository (that is used to find existing objects).

On the other hand, from an end-users' perspective the act of finding an existing object vs creating a new one are quite closely related.
For this reason, in Apache Isis it's therefore quite common to have a single domain service that acts as both a factory and a repository (and is usually called just a "repository").

The behaviour of these services is rendered in various ways, though the most obvious is as the menu actions on the top-level menu bars in the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]'s UI.

Domain services can also be used for a number of other purposes:

* to provide additional non-UI functionality; an example being to perform an address geocoding lookup against the google-maps API, or to perform some calculation, or attach a barcode, send an email etc

* to act as a subscribers to the event bus, potentially influencing events fired by some other module (a key technique for decoupling large applications) +
+
This is discussed in more detail below, in the section on xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events[events].

* to implement an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[SPI] of the Apache Isis framework, most notably cross-cutting concerns such as security, command profiling, auditing and publishing.

* to contribute behaviour or (derived) state to entities/view models. +
+

[NOTE]
====
Mixins can do everything that contributed services can, and have a cleaner programming model.
As such, contributed services should be considered a deprecated feature; it may be removed in a future release.
====

Domain objects of any type (entities, other services, view models, mixins) can also delegate to domain services; domain services are automatically injected into every other domain object.
This injection of domain services into entities is significant: it allows business logic to be implemented in the domain entities, rather than have it "leach away" into
supporting service layers.
Said another way: it is the means by which Apache Isis helps you avoid the anaemic domain model anti-pattern.

Domain services are instantiated once and once only by the framework, and are used to centralize any domain logic that does not logically belong in a domain entity or value.

[TIP]

== Hexagonal Arch. + services

It's worth extending the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts_philosophy_hexagonal-architecture[Hexagonal Architecture] to show where domain services fit in:

The (non-ASF) link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] provide SPI implementations of the common cross-cutting concerns.
They also provide a number of APIs for domain objects to invoke (not shown in the diagram).
You can also write your own domain services as well, for example to interface with some external CMS system, say.
