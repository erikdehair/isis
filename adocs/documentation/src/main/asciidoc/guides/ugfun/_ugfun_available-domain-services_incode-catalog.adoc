The link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog] website also provides a number of reusable modules, focusing on business logic for generic subdomains.

This section surveys the functionality available.

The modules themselves fall into a number of broader groups:

* modules that provide standalone domain entities (and supporting services) for a particular subdomain +

The http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias[alias], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification[classification], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel[commchannel], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications[communications], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-country[country], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment[docfragment],
http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[document] and http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[note] modules fall into this category.

* modules that provide developer/testing utilities +

The http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-fixturesupport[fixturesupport], http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-integtestsupport[integtestsupport] and http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-unittestsupport[unittestsupport] modules fall into this category.

Each of the modules has a full README and demo application demonstrating their usage.  The sections below briefly outline the capabilities of these modules.
