When the framework renders a domain object, and as the end-user interacts with the domain object, the framework it emits multiple events using the intra-process xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[event bus].
These events enable other domain services (possibly in other modules) to influence how the domain object is rendered, or to perform side-effects or even veto an action invocation.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to simulate the rendering of a domain object by way of the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`].
This allows business rules to be enforced for programmatic interactions between objects.
====

To receive the events, the domain service should subscribe to the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`], and implement an appropriately annotated method to receive the events.

The framework has several categories of events: domain events, UI events and lifecycle events.
These are explored in the sections below.
