As noted in the introduction, while mixins were originally introduced as a means of allowing contributions from one module to the types of another module, they are also a convenient mechanism for grouping functionality/behaviour against a concrete type.
All the methods and supporting methods end up in a single construct, and the dependency between that functionality and the rest of the object is made more explicit.

When using mixins in this fashion, it is idiomatic to write the mixin as a nested static class, using the naming convention described above to reduce duplication.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Mixin(method="act")
    public static class placeOrder {                                            // <1>

        private final Customer customer;
        public documents(Customer customer) { this.customer = customer; }       // <2>

        @Action
        @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ACTION)
        public List<Order> act(Product p, int quantity) {                        // <3>
            ...
        }
        public boolean hideAct() { ... }                                         // <4>
        public String validate0Act(Product p) { ...  }
    }
}
----
<1> Prior to `1.13.2`, had to be prefixed by an "_"; this is no longer required because "$" is also recognized as a way of parsing the class name in order to infer the mixin's name (eg `Customer$placeOrder`).
<2> typically contributed to concrete class
<3> supporting methods as usual


The mixin class can also be capitalized if desired.
Thus:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Mixin(method="act")
    public static class PlaceOrder {
        private final Customer customer;
        public documents(Customer customer) { this.customer = customer; }

        @Action
        @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ACTION)
        public List<Order> act(Product p, int quantity) {
            ...
        }
        public boolean hideAct() { ... }
        public String validate0Act(Product p) { ...  }
    }
}
----


In other words, all of the following are allowed:

* `public static class Documents { ... }`
* `public static class documents { ... }`
* `public static class _Documents { ... }`
* `public static class _documents { ... }`
