Buying packaged software makes sense for statutory requirements, such as payroll or general ledger, or document management/retrieval.
But (we argue) it makes much less sense to buy packaged software for the systems that support the core business: the software should fit the business, not the other way around.

Packaged software suffers from the problem of both having doing "too much" and "not enough":

* it does "too much" because it will have features that are not required by your business.
These extra unnecessary features make the system difficult to learn and use.;

* but it may also do "too little" because there may be crucial functionality not supported by the software.

The diagram below illustrates the dichotomy:

What happens in this case is that end-users -- needing some sort of solution for their particular business problem -- will end up using unused fields to store the information they need.
We end up with no correlation between the fields definitions and the values stored therein, sometimes with the datatypes not even matching.
Any business rules pertaining to this extra data have to be enforced manually by the users, rather than by the system.
The end result is a system even more complicated to learn and use, with the quality of the data held within it degrading as end users inevitably make mistakes in using it.

There are other benefits too for building rather than buying.
Packaged software is almost always sold with a support package, the cover of which can vary enormously.
At one end of the spectrum the support package ("bronze", say) will amount to little more than the ability to raise bug reports and to receive maintenance patches.
At the other end ("platinum"?), the support package might provide the ability to influence the direction of the development of the product, perhaps specific features missing by the business.

Even so, the more widely used is the software package, the less chance of getting it changed.
Does anyone reading this think they could get a new feature added (or removed) from Microsoft Word, for example?

Here's another reason why you should build, and not buy, the software supporting your core business domain.
Although most packaged software is customisable to a degree, there is always a limit to what can be customised.
The consequence is that the business is forced to operate according to the way in which the software requires.

This might be something as relatively innocuous as imposing its own terminology onto the business, meaning that the end-users must mentally translate concepts in order to use the software.
But it might impose larger constraints on the business; some packaged software (we carefully mention no names) is quite notorious for this

If your business is using the same software as your competitor, then obviously there's no competitive advantage to be gained.
And if your competitor has well-crafted custom software, then your business will be at a competitive __dis__advantage.

So, our philosophy is that custom software -- for your core business domain -- is the way to go.
Let's now look more closely at the types of custom applications you can consider building with the framework.
