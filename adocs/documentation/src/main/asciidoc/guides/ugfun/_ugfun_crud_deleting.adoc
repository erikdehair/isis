Domain entities can be deleted using xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`].
For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = ...
repositoryService.remove(customer);
----

It's worth being aware that (as for persisting new entities) the framework does _not_ eagerly delete the object.
Rather, it queues up an internal command structure representing the object deletion request.
This is then executed either at the end of the transaction, or if a  xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_crud_finding[query is run], or if the internal queue is manually flushed using xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`]'s `flush()` method.

Alternatively, you can use:

[source,java]
----
repositoryService.removeAndFlush(customer);
----

to eagerly perform the object deletion from the database.

When an object is deleted the framework will emit `ObjectRemovingEvent` xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle event].
