A collection is an instance variable of a domain object, of a collection type that holds references to other domain objects.
For example, a `Customer` may have a collection of ``Order``s).

It's ok for a xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#__ugfun_programming-model_class-definition_entities[domain entity] to reference another domain entity, and for a xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#__ugfun_programming-model_class-definition_view-models[view model] to reference both view model and domain entities.
However, it isn't valid for a domain entity to hold a persisted reference to view model (DataNucleus will not know how to persist that view model).

Formally speaking, a collection is simply a regular JavaBean getter, returning a collection type (subtype of `java.util.Collection`).
Most collections (those that are modifiable) will also have a setter and (if persisted) a backing instance field.
And collections properties will also have a number of annotations:

* Apache Isis defines its own set own `@Collection` annotation for capturing domain semantics.
It also provides a `@CollectionLayout` for UI hints (though the information in this annotation may instead be provided by a supplementary xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout[`.layout.xml`] file

* the collections of domain entities are often annotated with various JDO/DataNucleus annotations, most notable `javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent`.
This and other annotations can be used to specify if the association is bidirectional, and whether to define a link table or not to hold foreign key columns.

* for the collections of view models, then JAXB annotations such as `@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElementWrapper` and `@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement` will be present

Apache Isis recognises some of these annotations for JDO/DataNucleus and JAXB and infers some domain semantics from them (for example, the maximum allowable length of a string property).

Unlike xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_programming-model_properties[properties], the framework (at least, the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]) does not allow collections to be "edited".
Instead, xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_programming-model_actions[action]s can be written that will modify the contents of the collection as a side-effect.
For example, a `placeOrder(...)` action will likely add an `Order` to the `Customer#orders` collection.

Since writing getter and setter methods adds quite a bit of boilerplate, it's common to use link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] to code generate these methods at compile time (using Java's annotation processor) simply by adding the `@lombok.Getter` and `@lombok.Setter` annotations to the field.



[[__ugfun_programming-model_collections_mapping-bidir-1m]]
== Mapping bidir 1:m

Bidirectional one-to-many collections are one of the most common types of associations between two entities.
In the parent object, the collection can be defined as:

[source,java]
----
public class ParentObject
        implements Comparable<ParentObject>{

    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(
        mappedBy = "parent",                                                // <1>
        dependentElement = "false"                                          // <2>
    )
    @Collection                                                             // <3>
    @lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
    private SortedSet<ChildObject> children = new TreeSet<ChildObject>();   // <4>

}
----
<1> indicates a bidirectional association; the foreign key pointing back to the `Parent` will be in the table for `ChildObject`
<2> disable cascade delete
<3> (not actually required in this case, because no attributes are set, but acts as a useful reminder that this collection will be rendered in the UI by Apache Isis)
<4> uses a `SortedSet` (as opposed to some other collection type; discussion below)

while in the child object you will have:

[source,java]
----
public class ChildObject
        implements Comparable<ChildObject> {    // <1>

    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(
        allowsNull = "false"                    // <2>
    )
    @Property(editing = Editing.DISABLED)       // <3>
    @lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
    private ParentObject parent;
}
----
<1> implements `Comparable` because is mapped using a `SortedSet`
<2> mandatory; every child must reference its parent
<3> cannot be edited directly

Generally speaking you should use `SortedSet` for collection types (as opposed to `Set`, `List` or `Collection`).
JDO/Datanucleus does support the mapping of these other types, but RDBMS are set-oriented, so using this type introduces the least friction.

[NOTE]
====
For further details on mapping associations, see the JDO/DataNucleus documentation for link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_1/jdo/orm/one_to_many.html[one-to-many] associations, link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_1/jdo/orm/many_to_one.html[many-to-one] associations, link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_1/jdo/orm/many_to_many.html[many-to-many] associations, and so on.

Also, while JDO/DataNucleus itself supports `java.util.Map` as a collection type, this is not supported by Apache Isis.
If you do wish to use this collection type, then annotate the getter with `@Programmatic` so that it is ignored by the Apache Isis framework.
====



== Value vs Reference Types

Apache Isis can (currently) only provide a UI for collections of references.
While you can use DataNucleus to persist collections/arrays of value types, such properties must be annotated as `@Programmatic` so that they are ignored by Apache Isis.

If you want to visualize an array of value types in Apache Isis, then one option is to wrap value in a view model, as explained xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugbtb_hints-and-tips_simulating-collections-of-values[elsewhere].



[[__ugfun_programming-model_collections_derived-collections]]
== Derived Collections

A derived collection is simply a getter (no setter) that returns a `java.util.Collection` (or subtype).

While derived properties and derived collections typically "walk the graph" to associated objects, there is nothing to prevent the returned value being the result of invoking a repository (domain service) action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    ...
    public List<Order> getMostRecentOrders() {
        return orderRepo.findMostRecentOrders(this, 5);
    }
}
----
