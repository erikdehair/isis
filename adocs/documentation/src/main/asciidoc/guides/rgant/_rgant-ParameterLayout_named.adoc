The `named()` attribute explicitly specifies the action parameter's name. This attribute can also be specified for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_named[actions], xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_named[collections], xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_named[properties], xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_named[domain objects], xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_named[view models] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_named[domain services].

Unlike most other aspects of the Apache Isis metamodel, the name of method parameters cannot (prior to Java 8, at least) be inferred from the Java source code.
Without other information, Apache Isis uses the object's type (`int`, `String` etc) as the name instead.
This can be sufficient for application-specific reference types (eg `ToDoItem`) but is generally not sufficient for primitives and other value types.
The `named()` attribute is therefore often required to specify the parameter name.

As of Java 8, the Java reflection API has been extended.
The (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s paraname8 metamodel extension provides support for this.
Note that your application must (obviously) be running on Java 8, and be compiled with the `-parameters` compile flag for javac.



By default the name is HTML escaped.
To allow HTML markup, set the related `namedEscaped()` attribute to `false`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product
           ,@ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}

The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[internationalization].
