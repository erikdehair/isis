The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] allows additional views to be configured to render collections of objects; at the time of writing thesee include the excel, fullcalendar2 and gmap3 provided by the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^].
If the objects to be rendered have the correct "shape", then the appropriate view will be made available.  For example, objects with a date can be rendered using `calendar`; objects with locations can be rendered using `map`.

The `defaultView()` attribute is used to select which of these views should be used by default for a given collection.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BusRoute {
    @CollectionLayout(
        defaultView="map"
    )
    public SortedSet<BusStop> getStops() { ... }
    ...
}
----


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead, eg:

NOTE: FIXME - change to .layout.xml syntax instead.

[source,javascript]
----
"dependencies": {
    "collectionLayout": {
        "defaultView": "map"
    }
}
