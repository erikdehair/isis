Every property edit (and action invocation for that matter) is automatically reified into a concrete `Command` object.
The `@Property(command=..., commandXxx=...)` attributes provide hints for the persistence of that `Command` object, and the subsequent processing of that persisted command.
The primary use cases for this are to support the deferring the execution of the action such that it can be invoked in the background, and to replay commands in a master/slave configuration.


== Design

The annotation works with (and is influenced by the behaviour of) a number of domain services:

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`]
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_CommandService[`CommandService`]
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] and
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]


Each property edit is automatically reified by the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service into a `Command` object, capturing details of the target object, the property, the proposed new value fo the property, the user, a timestamp and so on.

If an appropriate `CommandService` is configured (for example using (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/command/spi-command.html[Incode Platform's command] module), then the `Command` itself is persisted.

By default, actions are invoked in directly in the thread of the invocation.
If there is an implementation of `BackgroundCommandService` (as the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module does provide), then this means in turn that the `BackgroundService` can be used by the domain object code to programmatically create background ``Command``s.

[NOTE]
====
If background ``Command``s are used, then an external scheduler, using xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_BackgroundCommandExecution[headless access], must also be configured.

[[_rgant-Property_commandPersistence]]
== `command()` and `commandPersistence()`

The `command()` and `commandPersistence() attributes work together to determine whether a command will actually be persisted.
There inter-relationship is somewhat complex, so is probably best explained by way of examples:

[cols="1a,1a,1a,1a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| `command()`
|`isis.services.
command.properties` config property
| `command
Persistence()`
| action dirties objects?
| is command persisted?

| `ENABLED`
| (any)
| `PERSISTED`
| (either)
| yes

| `ENABLED`
| (any)
| `IF_HINTED`
| no
| no

| `ENABLED`
| (any)
| `IF_HINTED`
| yes
| yes

| `ENABLED`
| (any)
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| (any)
| no

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `all`
| `PERSISTED`
| no
| yes

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `all`
| `IF_HINTED`
| no
| no

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `all`
| `IF_HINTED`
| yes
| yes

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `all`
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| (any)
| no

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `PERSISTED`
| no
| no (!)

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `PERSISTED`
| yes
| yes

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `IF_HINTED`
| no
| no

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `IF_HINTED`
| yes
| yes

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| no
| no

| `AS_CONFIGURED`
| `none`
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| yes
| yes (!)

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `PERSISTED`
| no
| no (!)

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `PERSISTED`
| yes
| yes

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `IF_HINTED`
| no
| no

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `IF_HINTED`

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| no
| no

| `DISABLED`
| (any)
| `NOT_PERSISTED`
| yes
| yes (!)

|===

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Property(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandPersistence=CommandPersistence.PERSISTED
    )
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    public void setProduct(Product p) { ... }
}
----

As can be seen, whether a command is actually persisted does not always follow the value of the `commandPersistence()` attribute.
This is because the `command()` attribute actually determines whether any command metadata for the action is captured within the framework's internal metamodel.
If `command` is `DISABLED` or does not otherwise apply due to the action's declared semantics, then the framework decides to persist a command based solely on whether the action dirtied any objects (as if `commandPersistence()` was set to `IF_HINTED`).



== `commandExecuteIn()`

For persisted commands, the `commandExecuteIn()` attribute determines whether the `Command` should be executed in the foreground (the default) or executed in the background.

Background execution means that the command is not executed immediately, but is available for a configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] to execute, eg by way of an in-memory scheduler such as Quartz.  See xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_BackgroundCommandExecution[here] for further information on this topic.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Property(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND
    )
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    public void setProduct(Product p) { ... }
}
----

will result in the `Command` being persisted but its execution deferred to a background execution mechanism.
The returned object from this property edit is the persisted `Command` itself.




== `commandDtoProcessor()`

The `commandDtoProcessor()` attribute allows an implementation of `CommandDtoProcessor` to be specified.
This interface has the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandDtoProcessor {
    CommandDto process(             // <1>
            Command command,        // <2>
            CommandDto dto);        // <3>
}
----
<1> The returned `CommandDto`.
This will typically be the `CommandDto` passed in, but supplemented in some way.
<2> The `Command` being processed
<3> The `CommandDto` (XML) obtained already from the `Command` (by virtue of it also implementing `CommandWithDto`, see discussion below).

This interface is used by the framework-provided implementations of `ContentMappingService` for the REST API, allowing ``Command``s implementations that also implement `CommandWithDto` to be further customised as they are serialized out.
The primary use case for this capability is in support of master/slave replication.

* on the master, ``Command``s are serialized to XML.
This includes the identity of the target object and the intended new value of the property.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
However, any ``Blob``s and ``Clob``s are deliberately excluded from this XML (they are instead stored as references).
This is to prevent the storage requirements for `Command` from becoming excessive.
A `CommandDtoProcessor` can be provided to re-attach blob information if required.
====

* replaying ``Command``s requires this missing parameter information to be reinstated.
The `CommandDtoProcessor` therefore offers a hook to dynamically re-attach the missing `Blob` or `Clob` argument.


As a special case, returning `null` means that the command's DTO is effectively excluded when retrieving the list of commands.
If replicating from master to slave, this effectively allows certain commands to be ignored.
The `CommandDtoProcessor.Null` class provides a convenience implementation for this requirement.

[NOTE]
====
If `commandDtoProcessor()` is specified, then `command()` is assumed to be ENABLED.
