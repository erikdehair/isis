The `promptStyle()` attribute is used to specify whether, when invoking an action associated with a domain object property, the parameters for the action are prompted by way of a dialog box, or is prompted using an inline panel (replacing the property on the page).

If the attribute is not set, then the value of the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_configuration-properties[configuration property] `isis.viewer.wicket.promptStyle` is used.
If this is itself not set, then an inline prompt is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public int getNotes(){ ... }
    public void setNotes(String notes) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(
            named="notes",                          // <1>
            sequence="1")
    @ActionLayout(
        promptStyle=PromptStyle.INLINE              // <2>
    )
    public int getNotes(){ ... }
    public void setNotes(String notes) { ... }
}
----
<1> associate this action with the "notes" property
<2> prompt for the action's parameters using an inline panel.

Exactly one action for a given property can be specified with `INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT`.
Assuming that the corresponding property is not itself editable, this means that the property will be rendered as if it is editable, but the action's prompt form will be rendered instead.
The net effect is that a property conceptually consisting of different parts (eg a name, an address or a date) can be updated using an action that lets each separate part be specified independently.


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead, eg:

NOTE: FIXME - provide .layout.xml example here
