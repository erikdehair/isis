The `@Mixin` annotation indicates that the class acts as a mixin, contributing behaviour - actions, (derived) properties and (derived) collections - to another domain object.

Mixins were originally introduced as a means of allowing contributions from one module to the types of another module; in such cases the mixin type is often an interface type (eg `DocumentHolder`) that might be implemented by numerous different concrete types.
However, mixins are also a convenient mechanism for grouping functionality even for a concrete type.

For further discussion on using mixins, see xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_mixins[mixins] in the user guide.

The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

|xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Mixin_method[`method()`]
|Method name within the mixin
|How to recognize the "reserved" method name, meaning that the mixin's own name will be inferred from the mixin type.
Typical examples are "exec", "execute", "invoke", "apply" and so on.
The default "reserved" method name is `$$`.

An alternative and equivalent approach is to use the
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`] annotation with a nature of `MIXIN`.
