The implementation of user interactions (meaning either an action invocations or a property edits) in the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is splits into two.
The first phase performs the actual interaction, with the results (dirtied objects) flushed to the database.
The second phase then renders the results of the interaction.

When the user interaction in question is an action invocation that returns a list of objects, the resultant list is not rendered in the first phase.
Instead, only the IDs of the objects in the list are captured.
When the list is then rendered, the framework re-loads each object.

The default implementation does this row-by-row, resulting in multiple queries against the database.
Setting the property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.standaloneCollection.bulkLoad=true
----

changes to a more efficient implementation that bulk loads all the objects using a single query.


[NOTE]
====
In the future the bulkLoad implementation may be made the default.

[NOTE]
====
The implementation of parented collections does not suffer from this issue; the rendering phase runs the query to obtain the matches.
