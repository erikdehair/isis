The `SessionLoggingService` defines an SPI to keep track of (typically: to log) the current sessions that are using the application.


== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface SessionLoggingService {
    public enum Type { LOGIN, LOGOUT }
    public enum CausedBy { USER, SESSION_EXPIRATION, RESTART }

    void log(
        Type type,
        String username,
        Date date,
        CausedBy causedBy,
        String sessionId);  // <1>
}
----
<1> an internal identifier (the JVM hashCode of the Wicket session).




== Implementations

The framework provides an implementation, `SessionLoggingService.Stderr` that just prints out to standard error.
This is not registered by default, but can be easily registered manually using `AppManifestAbstract.Builder#withAdditionalServices(...)`.

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-sessionlogger[Sessionlogger module] provides an implementation that logs each session as a JDO entity.
