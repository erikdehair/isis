The `ContentMappingService` supports the (default implementation of the) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_presentation-layer_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`] enabling the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] to represent domain objects in some other format as specified by the HTTP `Accept` header.

See xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_presentation-layer_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`] for further discussion.


[NOTE]
====
Unlike most other domain services, the framework (that is, `ContentNegotiationService`) will check _all_ available
implementations of `ContentMappingService` to convert the domain object to the requested media type, rather than merely
the first implementation found; in other words it uses the chain-of-responsibility pattern.  Services are checked
in the ordering defined by xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`]).
The mapped object used will be the first non-`null` result returned by an implementation.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ContentMappingService {
    Object map(Object object,                           // <1>
               List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes);   // <2>
}

----
<1> typically the input is a domain object (whose structure might change over time), and the output is a DTO (whose structure is guaranteed to be preserved over time)
<2> as per the caller's HTTP `Accept` header

== Implementations

The framework provides two implementations of this service, both in support of the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] SPI.

By way of background: implementations of the SPI `CommandService` work with custom implementations of the `Command` interface, typically being persisted to a datastore.
The `CommandWithDto` interface is a subtype of `Command` for implementations that can be reified into xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd[`CommandDto`] XML instances.
One implementation that does this is the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module.

For framework implementations of `ContentMappingService` allow domain service actions that return ``CommandDto``s (either singularly or in a list) to be converted into XML documents:

* `o.a.i.applib.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto` will map any single instnce of a `CommandWithDto` into a `CommandDto` XML document
* `o.a.i.applib.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandsDto` will map list of ``CommandWithDto``s into a `CommandsDto` XML document, and will wrap any single instance of a `CommandWithDto` into a singleton list and thence into a `CommandsDto` XML document.

If the action invocation or property edit represent provides an implementation of a `CommandDtoProcessor` (by way of xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_command[`@Action#commandDtoProcessor()`] or xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_command[`@Property#commandDtoProcessor()`]) then this is also called to post-process the persisted `CommandDto` if required.
A typical use case for this is to dynamically add in serialized ``Blob``s or ``Clob``s, the values of which are not captured by default in `CommandDto`.

To support the writing of custom implementations of this interface, the framework also provides `ContentMappingService.Util` which includes a couple of convenience utilities:

[source,java]
----
public static class Util {
    public static String determineDomainType(
        final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { ... }
    public static boolean isSupported(
            final Class<?> clazz,
            final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { ... }
}
----




== Related Services

This service is a companion to the default implementation of the xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_presentation-layer_ContentNegotiationService[`ContentNegotiationService`].

The framework implementations of `ContentMappingService` use the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_metadata-api_MetamodelService[`MetaModelService`] to lookup any custom implementations of `CommandDtoProcessor`.
