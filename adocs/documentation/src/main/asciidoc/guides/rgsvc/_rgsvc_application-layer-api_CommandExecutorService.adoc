The `CommandExecutorService` domain service is provides the ability to execute a specified `Command`, optionally running the command with the identity of the user captured in that `Command`.

In fact, the service requires that the implementation of the `Command` being executed implements the `CommandWithDto` sub-interface.
This allows the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd[`CommandDto`] memento to be extracted, from which the action can be invoked/property edited.

The primary use case for this service is to allow the replay of commands, eg for regression testing.
This is implemented by the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/command/spi-command-replay.html[command replay module].
(The command replay module also provides a decorator implementation of this service that allows the command to be re-executed at the same _time_ as the original command, leveraging the `TickingClock` implementation provided by the framework).


== API & Implementation

The `CommandExecutorService` defines the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandExecutorService {
    enum SudoPolicy {
        NO_SWITCH,
        SWITCH,
    }
    void executeCommand(
            SudoPolicy sudoPolicy,          // <1>
            CommandWithDto commandWithDto); // <2>
}
----
<1> whether to switch the effective user for the duration of executing the `Command`.
Behind the scenes this uses the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_testing_SudoService[`SudoService`].
<2> provided `Command` must implement `CommandDto`.

When the `Command` is executed, it will also be returned by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`].
Any associated objects that implement `HasTransactionId` (audit entries and the like) will therefore have the correct transactionId and will correctly be associated with the `Command` being executed.

The framework provides a default implementation of this service,
`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.background.CommandExecutorServiceDefault`
