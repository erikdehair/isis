The `HintStore` service defines an SPI for the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] to store UI hints on a per-object basis.
For example, the viewer remembers which tabs are selected, and for collections which view is selected (eg table or hidden),
which page of a table to render, or whether "show all" (rows) is toggled.

The default implementation of this service uses the HTTP session.  The service is an SPI because the amount of data
stored could potentially be quite large (for large numbers of users who use the app all day).  An SPI makes it easy to
plug in an alternative implementation that is more sophisticated than the default (eg implementing MRU/LRU queue, or
using a NoSQL database, or simply to disabling the functionality altogether).


== SPI

The SPI of `HintStore` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HintStore {
    String get(final Bookmark bookmark, String hintKey);                // <1>
    void set(final Bookmark bookmark, String hintKey, String value);    // <2>
    void remove(final Bookmark bookmark, String hintKey);               // <3>
    void removeAll(Bookmark bookmark);                                  // <4>
    Set<String> findHintKeys(Bookmark bookmark);                        // <5>
}
----
<1> obtain a hint (eg which tab to open) for a particular object.  Object identity is represented by `Bookmark`, as
per the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_integration-api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`], so that alternative implementations can easily serialize this state to a string.
<2> set the state of a hint.  (The value of) all hints are represented as strings.
<3> remove a single hint for an object;
<4> remove all hints
<5> obtain all known hints for an object



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.HintStoreUsingWicketSession`).



== View models

Hints are stored against the `Bookmark` of a domain object, essentially the identifier of the domain object.
For a domain entity this identifier is fixed and unchanging but for a view models the identifier changes each time the view model's state changes (the identifier is basically a digest of the object's state).
This means that any hints stored against the view model's bookmark are in effect lost as soon as the view model is modified.

To address this issue the `HintStore` provides an optional interface that the view model can implement, the intent of which is to expose the "logical" identity of the view model.
This interface is:


[source,java]
----
public interface HintStore {
    interface HintIdProvider {
        String hintId();
    }
}
----

For example, suppose that there's a view model that wraps a `Customer` and its ``Order``s
For this the `Customer` represents the logical identity.
This view model might therefore be implemented as follows:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement("customerAndOrders")
@XmlAccessType(FIELD)
public class CustomerAndOrders implements HintStore.HintIdProvider {

    @Getter @Setter
    private Customer customer;

    ...

    @Programmatic
    public String hintId() {
        bookmarkService.bookmarkFor(getCustomer()).toString();
    }

    @XmlTransient
    @Inject BookmarkService bookmarkService;
}
----




== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `HintStore` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Related Services

The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] exposes the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#__rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_clearHints["clear hints"]
mixin action that is for use by end-users of the application to clear any UI hints that have accumulated for a
domain object.
