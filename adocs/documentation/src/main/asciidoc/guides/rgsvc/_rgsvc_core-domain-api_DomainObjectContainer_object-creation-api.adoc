The (deprecated) object creation APIs is used to instantiate a view model, specifying its memento.

[source,java]
----
public interface DomainObjectContainer {

    <T> T newViewModelInstance(final Class<T> ofType, final String memento);        // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> create a new view model, with the specified memento (as per xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractViewModel[ViewModel#viewModelMemento()].

[TIP]
====
In general it is easier to just annotate with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`], or as a JAXB view model, and let Apache Isis manage the memento automatically.
