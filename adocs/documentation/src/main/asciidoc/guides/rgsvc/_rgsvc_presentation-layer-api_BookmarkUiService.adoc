The `BookmarkUiService` provides the ability to programmatically interact with bookmarked pages and breadcrumbs, as rendered by the Wicket viewer.

One possible use case is programmatically to support multiple "contexts" and allow the end-user to switch from one context to another.



== API & Implementation

The API defined by `BookmarkUiService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface BookmarkUiService {
    void clear();   // <1>
}
----
<1> Simply clears the current list of breadcrumbs and bookmarks.

The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service, `o.a.i.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.BookmarkUiServiceWicket`.
