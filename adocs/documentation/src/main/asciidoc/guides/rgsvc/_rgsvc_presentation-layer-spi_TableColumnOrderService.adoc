The `TableColumnOrderService` provides the ability to reorder (or suppress) columns in both parented- and standalone tables.


== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TableColumnOrderService {
    List<String> orderParented(                  // <1>
            Object parent,
            String collectionId,
            Class<?> collectionType,
            List<String> propertyIds);
    List<String> orderStandalone(                // <2>
            Class<?> collectionType,
            List<String> propertyIds);
}
----
<1> for the parent collection owned by the specified parent and collection Id, return the set of property ids in the same or other order.
<2> for the standalone collection of the specified type, return the set of property ids in the same or other order, else return `null` if provides no reordering.

There can be multiple implementations of `TableColumnOrderService` registered, ordered as per xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`].
The ordering provided by the first such service that returns a non-`null` value will be used.
If all provided implementations return `null`, then the framework will fallback to a default implementation.



== Implementation

The framework provides a fallback implementation of this service, namely `TableColumnOrderService.Default`.

There can be multiple implementations of `TableColumnOrderService registered.
These are checked in turn (chain of responsibility pattern), ordered according to xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
The order from the first service that returns a non null value will be used.
