The `TitleService` provides methods to programmatically obtain the title and icon of a domain object.



== API

The API of `TitleService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TitleService {
    String titleOf(Object domainObject);                // <1>
    String iconNameOf(Object domainObject);             // <2>
}
----
<1> return the title of the object, as rendered in the UI by the Apache Isis viewers.
<2> return the icon name of the object, as rendered in the UI by the Apache Isis viewers.



== Usage

By way of example, here's some code based on a system for managing government benefits:

[source,java]
----
public class QualifiedAdult {

    private Customer qualifying;

    public String title() {
        return "QA for " + titleService.titleOf(qualifying);
    }

    ...
    @Inject
    TitleService titleService;
}
----

In this example, whatever the title of a `Customer`, it is reused within the title of that customer's ``QualifiedAdult`` object.



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.title.TitleServiceDefault`).
