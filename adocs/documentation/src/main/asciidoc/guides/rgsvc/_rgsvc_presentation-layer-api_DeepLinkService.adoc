The `DeepLinkService` provides the ability to obtain a `java.net.URI` that links to a representation of any (persisted) domain entity or view model.

A typical use case is to generate a clickable link for rendering in an email, PDF, tweet or other communication.



== API & Implementation

The API defined by `DeepLinkService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DeepLinkService {
    URI deepLinkFor(Object domainObject); // <1>
}
----
<1> Creates a URI that can be used to obtain a representation of the provided domain object in one of the Apache Isis viewers.

The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service `o.a.i.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.DeepLinkServiceWicket`.

For the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer], a URL can be constructed according to the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] in conjunction with a `Bookmark` obtained via the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_integration-api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`].



== Usage within the framework

The xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_EmailNotificationService[`EmailNotificationService`] uses this service in order to generate emails as part of xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_user-registration[user registration].
