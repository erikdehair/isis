The `ServiceRegistry2` domain service (and its various supertypes)collects together methods for injecting or looking up domain services (either provided by the framework or application-specific) currently known to the runtime.



== API

The API of `ServiceRegistry` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ServiceRegistry {
    <T> T injectServicesInto(final T domainObject);     // <1>
    <T> T lookupService(Class<T> service);              // <2>
    <T> Iterable<T> lookupServices(Class<T> service);   // <3>
    List<Object> getRegisteredServices();               // <4>
}
----
<1> injects services into domain object; used extensively internally by the framework (eg to inject to other services, or to entities, or integration test instances, or fixture scripts).
<2> returns the first registered service that implements the specified class
<3> returns an `Iterable` in order to iterate over all registered services that implement the specified class
<4> returns the list of all domain services that constitute the running application (including internal domain services).

Service injection is done automatically if objects are created using the
xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`].



== Usage

The primary use case is to instantiate domain objects using a regular constructor ("new is the new new"), and then using the `#injectServicesInto(...)` API to set up any dependencies.

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = serviceRegistry.injectServicesInto( new Customer());
cust.setFirstName("Freddie");
cust.setLastName("Mercury");
repositoryService.persist(cust);
----

The alternative is to use the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`] API which performs both steps in a single factory method.



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.registry.ServiceRegistryDefault`).
