The `HsqlDbManagerMenu` provides a single menu item to open up the HSQLDB manager.
This is only enabled for prototyping, and if HSQLDB is detected in the underlying JDBC URL.
The menu appears under the "Prototyping" menu.


== API & Implementation

The API of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class HsqlDbManagerMenu {
    public void hsqlDbManager() { ... }
}
----

Note that this launches the manager on the same host that the webapp runs, and so is only appropriate to use when running on `localhost`.


== Disabling/hiding the menu

The menu can be hidden or disabled by subscribing to its domain event, eg:


[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=DOMAIN)
public void HideHsqlDbManagerMenu extends AbstractSubscriber {

    @EventHandler @Subscribe
    public void on(HsqlDbManagerMenu.ActionDomainEvent ev) {
        ev.hide();
    }
}
----
