The `TransactionService2` provides a small number of methods to allow domain objects to influence user transactions.

[NOTE]
====
The methods in this service replace similar methods (now deprecated) in xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].
====


== API

The API of `TransactionService2` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TransactionService {
    Transaction currentTransaction();       // <1>
    void nextTransaction();                 // <2>
    void flushTransaction();                // <3>
    TransactionState getTransactionState(); // <4>
}
----
<1> to obtain a handle on the current `Transaction`, discussed further below
<2> The framework automatically start a transaction before each user interaction (action invocation or property edit), and will commit that transaction after the interaction has completed.  Under certain circumstances (eg actions used to perform data migration, say, or for large fixture scripts), it can be helpful to programmatically complete one transaction and start another one.
<3> If the user interaction creates/persists an object or deletes an object (eg using the
xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`]'s `persist()` or `delete()` methods), then the framework actually queues up the work and only performs the persistence command either at the end of the transaction or immediately prior to the next query.
Performing a flush will cause any pending calls to be performed immediately.
<4> the state of the current or most recently completed transaction.

Here `TransactionState` is an enum defined as:

[source,java]
----
public enum TransactionState {
    NONE,       // <1>
    IN_PROGRESS,    // <2>
    MUST_ABORT,     // <3>
    /**
    COMMITTED,      // <4>
    ABORTED;        // <5>
}
----
<1> No transaction exists.
<2> Started, still in progress.
May flush, commit or abort.
<3> Started, but has hit an exception.
May not flush or commit, can only abort.
<4> Completed, having successfully committed.
May not flush or abort or commit.
<5> Completed, having aborted.
Again, may not flush or abort or commit.

The `nextTransaction()` is also used by the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]'s support for bulk actions; each action is invoked in its own transaction.

The `Transaction` object - as obtained by `currentTransaction()` method, above - is a minimal wrapper around the underlying database transaction.  Its API is:

[source,java]
----
public interface Transaction {
    UUID getTransactionId();            // <1>
    int getSequence();                  // <2>
    void flush();                       // <3>
    void clearAbortCause();             // <4>
}
----
<1> is a unique identifier for the interaction/request, as defined by the
xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_HasTransactionId[`HasTransactionId`] mixin.
<2> there can actually be multiple transactions within such a request/interaction; the sequence is a (0-based) is used to distinguish such.
<3> as per `TransactionService#flushTransaction()` described above.
<4> If the cause has been rendered higher up in the stack, then clear the cause so that it won't be picked up and rendered elsewhere.

[TIP]
====
One place where `clearAboutCause()` may be useful is for application-level handling of SQL integrity exceptions, eg as described in link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1476[ISIS-1476]:

[source,java]
----
try {
    // do something...
} catch (final JDODataStoreException e) {
    if (Iterables.filter(Throwables.getCausalChain(e),
        SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException.class) != null) {
        // ignore
        this.transactionService.currentTransaction().clearAbortCause();
    } else {
        throw e;
    }
}

== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service, `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.xactn.TransactionServiceDefault`.



== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the `AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core implementation of `TransactionService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
