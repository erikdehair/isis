The `TranslationsResolver` service is one of the services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`].

The role of the service itself is locate and return translations.


[NOTE]
====
For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[here].

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslationsResolver {
    @Programmatic
    List<String> readLines(final String file);
}
----


== Implementation

Isis' xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`TranslationsResolverWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.  This searches for translation files in the standard `WEB-INF/` directory.

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is no equivalent implementation for the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].
