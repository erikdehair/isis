The `MenuBarsLoaderService` is used by the default implementation of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_MenuBarsService[MenuBarsService] to return a a xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_menubars[`MenuBars`] instance deserialized from the `menubars.layout.xml` file read from the classpath.


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MenuBarsLoaderService {
    boolean supportsReloading();        // <1>
    MenuBars menuBars();                // <2>
}
----
<1> Whether dynamic reloading of the menu bars layout is enabled.
If not, then the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_MenuBarsService[MenuBarsService] will cache the layout once loaded.
<2> Returns a new instance of `MenuBars` if possible, otherwise null.


The framework provides a default implementation of this service, namely `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.menu.MenuBarsLayoutServiceDefault`.

This searches for a file resource `menubars.layout.xml`, expected to reside in the same package as the `AppManifest` used to bootstrap the application.

It supports reloading only in prototype mode.
