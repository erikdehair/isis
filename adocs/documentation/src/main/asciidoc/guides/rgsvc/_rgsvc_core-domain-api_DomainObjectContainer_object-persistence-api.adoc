The (deprecated) persistence API is used to persist newly created objects (as per xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer_object-creation-api[`#newTransientInstance(...)`], above and to delete (remove) objects that are persistent.

[TIP]
====
Instead, use xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`] API.
====

Note that there is no API for updating existing objects; the framework (or rather, JDO/DataNucleus) performs object dirty tracking and so any objects that are modified in the course of a request will be automatically updated).



[source,java]
----
public interface DomainObjectContainer {

    boolean isViewModel(Object domainObject);           // <1>
    void persist(Object domainObject);                  // <2>
    void remove(Object persistentDomainObject);         // <3>

    ...
}
----
<1> test whether a particular domain object is a view model or not.
Note that this includes any domain objects annotated with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=Nature.EXTERNAL_ENTITY)`] or xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature=Nature.INMEMORY_ENTITY`]
<2> persist a transient object.
Note though that this will throw an exception if the object is already persistent; this can happen if JDO/DataNucleus's link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_0/jdo/orm/cascading.html[persistence-by-reachability] is in effect.
For this reason it is generally better to use xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService#persist()`], which is a no-op if the object is persistent.
<5> remove (ie DELETE) a persistent object.
However, the object must be persistent already, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
It is generally therefore better to use use xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService#remove()`], which is a no-op if the object is not persistent.

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = container.newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
cust.setFirstName("Freddie");
cust.setLastName("Mercury");
container.persistIfNotAlready(cust);
----

You should be aware that by default Apache Isis queues up calls to `#persist()` and `#remove()`.  These are then executed either when the request completes (and the transaction commits), or if the queue is flushed.  This can be done either implicitly by the framework, or as the result of a direct call to `TransactionService#flushTransaction()`.
