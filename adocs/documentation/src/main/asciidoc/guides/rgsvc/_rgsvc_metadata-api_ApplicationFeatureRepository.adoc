The `ApplicationFeatureRepository` provides the access to string representations of the packages, classes and
class members (collectively: "application features") of the domain classes within the Apache Isis' internal metamodel.

[TIP]
====
This functionality was originally implemented as part of (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] security module, where the string representations of the various features are used to represent permissions.
====


== API

The API defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationFeatureRepository {
    List<String> packageNames();
    List<String> packageNamesContainingClasses(ApplicationMemberType memberType);
    List<String> classNamesContainedIn(String packageFqn, ApplicationMemberType memberType);
    List<String> classNamesRecursivelyContainedIn(String packageFqn);
    List<String> memberNamesOf(String packageFqn, String className, ApplicationMemberType memberType);
}
----

where `ApplicationMemberType` in turn is:

[source,java]
----
public enum ApplicationMemberType {
    PROPERTY,
    COLLECTION,
    ACTION;
}
----

These methods are designed primarily to return lists of strings for use in drop-downs.


== Implementation

The default implementation of this service is `ApplicationFeatureRepositoryDefault`.


=== Configuration Properties

The default implementation of this domain service supports the following configuration properties:

[cols="2a,1,3a", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(default value)
|Description

|`isis.services.` +
`applicationFeatures.` +
`init`
| `lazy`, `eager` +
(`lazy`)
|Whether the application features repository (which surfaces the framework's metamodel) should be
initialized lazily or eagerly.  +

Lazy initialization can speed up bootstrapping, useful while developing and running tests.

=== Related Services

The default implementation of this service uses the `ApplicationFeatureFactory` service to instantiate `ApplicationFeature` instances.
