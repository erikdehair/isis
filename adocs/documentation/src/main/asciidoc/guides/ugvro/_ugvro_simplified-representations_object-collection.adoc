If a domain object collection (section 17) is accessed with this profile, then the resultant representation is as
an array of elements of key/value for each referenced object, and again each element the containing the key/value
pairs of the properties of that object (a grid, again). +

In addition, the representation defined by the RO spec is also included, as a special object with a single `$$ro`
property.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45/collections/similarTo
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

<3> instance id of the domain object (unique within its type)
<4> title of the domain object
<5> all the properties of the domain object (to which the caller has access), as key/value pairs
<6> last element is a special object with a single `$$ro` json-prop, being the normal RO Spec representation for this object
