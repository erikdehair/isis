If a domain object resource (section 14) is accessed with the Apache Isis profile, the resultant representation is a
JSON object with simple key/value pairs for each property.

The contents of any collections are also eagerly returned, consisting of an array of elements of each referenced
object.  Each such element contains key/value pairs of each property (in other words, a grid of data is returned).
Each element also has a special `$$href` property (so that the client can easily navigate to a resource for that
object) and a `$$title` property (to use as a label, eg the hyperlink text).

In addition, the representation defined by the RO spec is also included, under a special `$$ro` property.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----
{
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",       // <1>
  "$$instanceId" : "45",                                            // <2>
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",                        // <3>
  "description" : "Buy bread",                                      // <4>
