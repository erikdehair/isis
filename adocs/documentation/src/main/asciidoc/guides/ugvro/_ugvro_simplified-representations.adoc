The representations defined by the RO spec are very rich and enable complex client-side applications to be built.
However, their sophistication can be an impediment to their use if one wishes to write a simple app using third-party components that expect to consume much simpler representations.

As of `1.11.0`, Apache Isis provides support for its own simplified representation for the most commonly-used representations.
This is implemented using the `ContentNegotiationService` described in the
xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_architecture[architecture] chapter.
